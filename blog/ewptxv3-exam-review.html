    <h1>eWPTXv3 Exam Review</h1>

    <p>I have recently passed the new v3 format of the eWPTX (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester eXtreme)
        exam, a highly sought-after certification in the world of web application security that frequently appears in
        job postings.</p>

    <h2>The Big Shift from v2 to v3: Where Did the 7 Days Go?</h2>
    <p>Those familiar with the older version (v2) of eWPTX will remember that the exam gave you a 7-day lab period and
        an extra 7 days to report your findings. It was quite comprehensive and close to a real-world scenario.</p>

    <p>With the v3 update, this format has completely changed. The new exam is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 18 Hours</li>
        <li><strong>Format:</strong> 45 Questions (Multiple-choice questions and Flags to be captured from target
            machines).</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> None.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you ask for my personal opinion, I would have preferred the old 7-day, manual format that required reporting
        and in-depth examination. V3 has transformed into more of a “Search-Find-Apply” (CVE-focused) structure rather
        than a manual penetration testing experience.</p>

    <h2>The Preparation Process and Training Content (Is it Necessary?)</h2>
    <p>I purchased the certification along with INE’s own training content. My opinion on the training material will
        vary depending on your current level:</p>

    <p><strong>If you are at “Zero” in this field:</strong> The training content is definitely useful and helps you
        build a solid foundation.</p>

    <p><strong>If you already have a “Background”:</strong> I do not recommend buying the training content. If you have
        previously solved HTB or PortSwigger labs, or established a foundation in web security, going straight to the
        exam would make more sense in terms of time and cost. Personally, the v3 training did not contribute much to my
        technical knowledge base.</p>

    <h2>Exam Day: The 18-Hour Duration and Time Management</h2>
    <p>The 18-hour time limit given for the exam is more than enough for 45 questions. In fact, I completed the exam in
        a very short time, well below the allotted limit. I took a long break with the remaining time, checked my
        answers one last time, and then submitted the exam.</p>

    <p>The questions were based on recognizing specific vulnerabilities and CVEs, finding the right “PoC” (Proof of
        Concept) codes on the internet, and applying them to the target, rather than in-depth manual exploitation.
        Therefore, being able to discover the name and version of the target product is crucial.</p>

    <h2>My Biggest Critique: The Exam Environment and Restrictions</h2>
    <p>INE’s exam environment was quite stable; I didn’t experience any issues like connection drops. However, there was
        one huge disadvantage: No VPN support.</p>

    <p>You have to solve the exam through a restricted “Attacker Machine” that you connect to via a browser and which
        has no internet access. This means you cannot use your customized toolset, special configurations on your own
        computer, or the practical automation tools you use in your daily life. I wish a VPN was provided so we could
        manage this process much faster in our own environment.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Instant Certification and the HR Filter</h2>
    <p>Since there is no reporting (Pentest Report) requirement in the exam, you learn instantly whether you passed or
        failed the moment you click the finish button.</p>

    <p>So, is this certification worth getting?</p>

    <p>Although it didn’t propel me into a new era technically, the answer to this question is “Yes”. Because eWPTX has
        a very strong brand presence in the cybersecurity industry. You see this certification in almost every “Web
        Pentester” job posting. Getting this certification is a great key to bypass HR (Human Resources) filters and get
        a seat at the interview table.</p>

    <p>Good luck in advance to everyone who will take the exam. Unlike the old format, you can easily pass this exam
        with good research skills and a mastery of basic web vulnerabilities!</p>
