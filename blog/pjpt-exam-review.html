    <h1>PJPT Exam Review: Preparation, Methodology and the Reporting Process</h1>

    <p>It has been almost a year since I passed the PJPT (Practical Junior Penetration Tester) exam. Due to my busy
        schedule back then, I am only now getting the chance to write about this experience. However, despite the time
        that has passed, the lessons I learned during the exam and my understanding of the Active Directory (AD) world
        remain highly relevant.</p>

    <p>In this article, I want to share my PJPT preparation process, the breaking points I experienced during the exam,
        and my reporting methodology to guide those who want to step into the cybersecurity field.</p>

    <h2>Why PJPT? (Comparison with eJPT)</h2>
    <p>When I decided to take the exam, my background was mostly in solving Web and Network labs, and I had no
        professional work experience yet. While eJPT is the first certification that comes to mind for entry-level
        candidates, I definitively set my course for PJPT. Why?</p>

    <p>To be honest, PJPT is a far better and much more realistic exam than eJPT. eJPT does not include Active Directory
        (AD), has no reporting requirement, and feels more like a basic CTF (Capture the Flag) environment. PJPT, on the
        other hand, offers a hands-on lab environment and requires you to compile your findings into a professional
        report at the end. For a Junior candidate looking to stand out in the industry, this reporting experience is
        invaluable.</p>

    <h2>Preparation Process and Timeline</h2>
    <p>I spread my preparation over a longer period due to my personal pace. However, I believe that someone who can
        study regularly with the right resources can be completely ready for this exam within 2 to 3 months.</p>

    <p>I built my preparation on two main pillars:</p>

    <p><strong>TCM Security — PEH (Practical Ethical Hacking) Course:</strong> I watched the entire course with great
        attention and took structured notes. I can comfortably say that the exam environment is perfectly aligned with
        the PEH curriculum.</p>
    <p><strong>Hack The Box (HTB) — Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks Module:</strong> I didn’t just stop at
        watching videos. This module on HTB Academy was incredibly helpful in putting my theoretical knowledge into
        practice.</p>

    <h2>Tool Stack</h2>
    <p>The most important philosophy I adopted during my preparation was: Do not condition yourself entirely on tools,
        but do not be tool-less either. Mastering the core tools shown in the TCM PEH course is enough to pass the exam.
    </p>

    <p>In addition to these, I also used NetExec for enumeration and lateral movement, as it streamlined several common
        Active Directory tasks without changing the underlying methodology.</p>

    <h2>My Exam Experience</h2>
    <p>TCM Security’s exam environment was very stable. On Friday evening when I started the exam, everything was going
        according to plan. I dominated the network and successfully compromised 2 client machines before midnight.
        However, I couldn’t find the path to the Domain Controller (DC) at the very top of the target. I felt stuck, so
        I closed the screen and decided to sleep.</p>

    <p>Even though I sat at the computer refreshed on Saturday morning, I was still missing that one detail right in
        front of my eyes. Realizing I had fallen into a “rabbit hole,” I got up from the screen and went outside.</p>

    <p>The Golden Rule: The moment you feel stuck in the exam, step away from the screen. I went out for just a
        20-minute walk and got some fresh air. When I returned to the computer, it took me exactly 2 minutes to
        compromise the Domain Controller. Sometimes the solution isn’t looking harder at the screen, but resetting the
        mind.</p>

    <h2>The Reporting Phase: Evidence Collection and Documentation</h2>
    <p>In penetration testing, how you convey your findings is just as important as your technical success. TCM Security
        is quite strict about this and expects reporting at real-world standards. My methodology during the reporting
        process was as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Taking Continuous Screenshots:</strong> From the beginning to the end of the exam, I documented every
        successful step and access I gained with real-time screenshots.</p>
    <p><strong>Using the Template:</strong> I didn’t waste time designing a report from scratch. I used the Word report
        template provided by TCM Security.</p>
    <p><strong>Detail and Volume:</strong> I thoroughly explained the vulnerabilities I found, their business impact,
        and remediation steps. When my report was complete, it was a satisfying and professional penetration test report
        of about 40–50 pages.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion and Future Goals</h2>
    <p>After completing my report and uploading it to the system, the waiting period was quite short. Within just 1–2
        days, I received that exciting email from the TCM Security team stating that my report was accepted and I
        successfully passed the exam. This certification was not just a technical achievement; it was also proof that I
        could infiltrate a real corporate network and report it professionally.</p>

    <p>After building this strong foundation with PJPT, I have now set my sights on a more challenging target. I am
        currently studying intensely for the HTB CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) exam. I hope to write a
        review for this challenging exam in the future as well.</p>

    <p>Good luck to everyone in advance!</p>
